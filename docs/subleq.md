Guide to the SUBLEQ Interpreter
===============================

To use the SUBLEQ interpreter, build subleq.cpp and invoke the resulting binary
with:

```bash
$ subleq_binary_name path\to\subleq\input_binary
```

The SUBLEQ interpreter takes a path to a binary generated by the SUBLEQ
compiler as it's only argument. It will print out the results of each SUBLEQ
subtract operation. The SUBLEQ interpreter will exit once it is instructed to
jump to an address of -1 (used by our SUBLEQ dialect as the address of the
terminal). See subleqc.md for more information on the SUBLEQ dialect.
